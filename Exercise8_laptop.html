            <p> A laptop computer or notebook computer, also laptop or notebook for short, is a small, portable personal computer (PC).
                 Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat panel screen (usually 11–17 in or 280–430 mm in diagonal 
                 size) on the inside of the upper lid, and an alphanumeric keyboard (typically QWERTY) on the inside of the lower lid,
                  although 2-in-1 PCs with a detachable keyboard are often marketed as laptops or as having a "laptop mode".[1][2] 
                  The internal hardwares are fitted inside the lower lid enclosure under the keyboard, and it's not uncommon for 
                  laptops to have a pointing device such as a trackpad or trackpoint. Many modern laptops also have a built-in webcam
                   and even a touch screen display.</p>

            <p> Laptops run on both AC power supply and rechargeable battery pack, and can be folded shut for convenient storage and 
                transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile use.[3] Today, laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at
                 work (especially on business trips), in education, for playing games, web browsing, for personal multimedia, and for 
                 general home computer use.</p>

            <p>
                The names laptop and notebook reference the fact that the computer can be practically placed on (top of) the user's lap,
                 and can be used similarly to a notebook. As of 2022, in American English, the terms laptop computer and notebook
                  computer are used interchangeably;[4] in other dialects of English, one or the other may be preferred.

                Laptops can be powered either from an internal battery or by an external power supply from an AC adapter. Hardware 
                specifications, such as the processor speed and memory capacity, significantly vary between different types, models and price points.

                Design elements, form factor and construction can also vary significantly between models depending on the intended use. 
                Examples of specialized models of laptops include rugged notebooks for use in construction or military applications, 
                as well as low production cost laptops such as those from the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) organization, which incorporate 
                features like solar charging and semi-flexible components not found on most laptop computers.
