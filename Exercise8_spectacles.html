            <p> Glasses, also known as eyeglasses or spectacles, are vision eyewear with lenses (clear or tinted) mounted in a frame that holds them in front of a person's
                 eyes, typically utilizing a bridge over the nose and hinged arms (known as temples or temple pieces) that rest over the ears.
                 Glasses are typically used for vision correction, such as with reading glasses and glasses used for nearsightedness; however, without the specialized
                 lenses, they are sometimes used for cosmetic purposes.</p>

            <p> Glasses wearers may use a strap to prevent the glasses from falling off. Wearers of glasses that are used only part of the time may have the glasses 
                attached to a cord that goes around their neck to prevent the loss and breaking of the glasses. The loss of glasses would be detrimental to those working
                 in these conditions.</p>

            <p>
                Sunglasses allow for better vision in bright daylight and may protect one's eyes against damage from excessive levels of ultraviolet light. 
                Typical sunglasses lenses are tinted for protection against bright light or polarized to remove glare; photochromic glasses are blacked out or 
                lightly tinted in dark or indoor conditions, but turn into sunglasses when they come into contact with ultraviolet light. Most over-the-counter 
                sunglasses do not have corrective power in the lenses; however, special prescription sunglasses can be made. People with conditions that have 
                photophobia as a primary symptom (like certain migraine disorders or Irlen syndrome) often wear sunglasses or precision tinted glasses, even 
                indoors and at night.
