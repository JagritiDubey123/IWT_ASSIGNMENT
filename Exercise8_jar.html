            <p> A jar is a rigid, cylindrical or slightly conical container, typically made of glass, ceramic, or plastic, with a wide mouth or opening that
                 can be closed with a lid, screw cap, lug cap, cork stopper, roll-on cap, crimp-on cap, press-on cap, plastic shrink, heat sealed lidding film, 
                 an inner seal, a tamper-evident band, or other suitable means.</p>

            <p> Jars can be used to hold solids too large to be removed from, or liquids too viscous to be poured through a bottle's neck; these may be foods, 
                cosmetics, medications, or chemicals.[4] Glass jars—among which the most popular is the mason jar—can be used for storing and preserving items 
                as diverse as jam, pickled gherkin, other pickles, marmalade, sun-dried tomatoes, olives, jalapeño peppers, chutneys, pickled eggs, honey, and 
                many others.</p>
