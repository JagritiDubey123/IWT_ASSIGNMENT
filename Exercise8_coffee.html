            <p> Coffee is a drink prepared from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating 
                effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It is the most popular hot drink in the world. Seeds of the Coffea
                 plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. The beans are roasted and then ground into fine particles
                  that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot, although
                   chilled or iced coffee is common</p>

            <p> Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied closely to food traditions around the Red Sea. The earliest credible 
                evidence of coffee drinking in the form of the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen from the mid-15th century in Sufi shrines, where 
                coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to current methods.</p>

                The word coffee entered the English language in 1582 via the Dutch koffie, borrowed from the Ottoman Turkish kahve , borrowed in turn from 
                the Arabic qahwah.[5] Medieval Arab lexicographers traditionally held that the etymology of qahwah meant 'wine', given its distinctly dark color,
                 and derived from the verb qahiya  'to have no appetite'.The word qahwah most likely meant 'the dark one', referring to the brew or the bean; 
                 qahwah is not the name of the bean, which are known in Arabic as bunn and in Cushitic languages as bÅ«n.
