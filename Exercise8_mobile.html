            <p> A mobile phone is a wireless handheld device that allows users to make and receive calls. While the earliest generation
                 of mobile phones could only make and receive calls, today’s mobile phones do a lot more, accommodating web browsers, 
                 games, cameras, video players and navigational systems..</p>

            <p> The first mobile phones, as mentioned, were only used to make and receive calls, and they were so bulky it was impossible
                 to carry them in a pocket. These phones used primitive RFID and wireless systems to carry signals from a cabled PSTN endpoint.
                 Later, mobile phones belonging to the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) network became capable of sending and 
                 receiving text messages.</p>

            <p>
                Along with the texting and camera features, cell phones started to be made with a limited capability to access the Internet, 
                known as “data services.” The earliest phone browsers were proprietary and only allowed for the use of a small subsection of 
                the Internet, allowing users to access items like weather, news, and sports updates.
